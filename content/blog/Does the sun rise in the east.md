title: Does the sun rise in the east ?

“As sure as the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.” it’s a phrase we’ve all heard as a symbol of certainty. But what if I told you this statement is only partly true, and in many places, not true at all? .While it’s _broadly_ correct that the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west, this isn’t consistently the case across the globe. The direction of sunrise and sunset actually **changes throughout the year** and **depends on where you are on Earth**. 

#### Why & How ?
The key lies in **Earth’s axial tilt**. Our planet is tilted at an angle of **23.5 degrees**, and this tilt is what gives us **seasons**. It also changes the **angle at which we see the Sun rise and set**. this tilt decides which hemisphere will face toward and away form the sun effecting the suns path and duration in the sky. these are the involved factors :
1. **Earth’s Rotation**: Earth rotates on its axis from **west to east** (counterclockwise if viewed from above the North Pole). **the Sun always rises in the eastern half of the sky** and sets in the western half
2. **Earth’s Tilt and Orbit**
	Earth is tilted **23.5°** relative to its orbital plane (the **ecliptic**), and this is the key to seasonal changes:
	- As Earth orbits the Sun, **different parts of the planet tilt toward or away from the Sun at different times of the year**.    
- This causes: Varying lengths of daylight (summer has longer days).Changing sunrise/sunset angles.
3. **Earth Orbits the Sun** : As Earth moves around the Sun during the year, the tilt causes **the Sun to appear higher or lower in the sky**, depending on the season and location.

### Directions 
The direction of sunrise (and sunset) shifts **along the horizon** over the course of the year. Here's how Note In the **Southern Hemisphere**, the pattern is reversed:
##### Equinoxes (around March 21 and September 23)
**Sun rises exactly due east**.**Sun sets exactly due west**. Day and night are approximately equal in length. This happens because the tilt of Earth’s axis is **sideways** relative to the Sun — no hemisphere is tilted toward or away.
##### ☀️ Summer Solstice (around June 21 in Northern Hemisphere)
Earth’s **North Pole is tilted toward the Sun**. **Sun rises farthest to the northeast**.This is the **longest day of the year** in the Northern Hemisphere. The Sun follows its **highest and longest path** across the sky. The Sun is **above the horizon for the longest period**. It appears nearly overhead at noon if you’re near the Tropic of Cancer.

##### ❄️ Winter Solstice (around December 21 in Northern Hemisphere)
Earth’s **North Pole is tilted away from the Sun**. **Sun rises farthest to the southeast**.This is the **shortest day of the year** in the Northern Hemisphere. The Sun takes its **shortest, lowest path** across the sky. It **rises in the southeast**, sets in the southwest. It’s **above the horizon for the shortest time**. The Sun is low in the sky even at noon.

**This Cycle Repeats Annually**
As Earth moves along its orbit, the angle of sunrise moves gradually from southeast → east → northeast → east → southeast again.

#### Relation between sunrise and sunset
Because of Earth’s **tilted axis and orbit**, both sunrise and sunset points move along the horizon through the seasons ,The **Sun rises and sets on opposite points of the horizon**. If it rises **northeast**, it will set **northwest**. If it rises **southeast**, it will set **southwest**.

#### So where does the sun rise ? 

| **Season**          | **Hemisphere**          | **Sun Rises** | **Sun Sets**  | **Sun Path (Arc)**         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Spring Equinox**  | Both Hemispheres        | Due **East**  | Due **West**  | Medium-height arc (12 hrs) |
| **Summer Solstice** | **Northern Hemisphere** | **Northeast** | **Northwest** | **High arc**, long days    |
|                     | **Southern Hemisphere** | **Southeast** | **Southwest** | **Low arc**, short days    |
| **Autumn Equinox**  | Both Hemispheres        | Due **East**  | Due **West**  | Medium arc (12 hrs)        |
| **Winter Solstice** | **Northern Hemisphere** | **Southeast** | **Southwest** | **Low arc**, short days    |
|                     | **Southern Hemisphere** | **Northeast** | **Northwest** | **High arc**, long days    |
##### Explanation :
The **Sun’s arc is higher** in your summer and **lower** in your winter. Earth's **tilt (23.5°)** causes the **Sun’s apparent path** to shift. In **June**, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted **toward** the Sun → Sun rises **northeast**. In **December**, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted **toward** the Sun → Sun rises **northeast** there instead.
